INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

I use MacPerl (5.8.0a2) and Win32 versions of Perl.
I have no experience with automatic installations (the standard make process).
If the above fails to install the module, please install manually:

1. Install MARC::Record (version 1.38 or greater).
2. Find where the MARC::Record module resides on your system.
3. Place the modules in lib/MARC/ in the MARC directory next to the Record.pm file.
(with new Lint directory for MARC::Lint::CodeData).
4. Place the files in the bin/ directory whereever such files normally go on your system.
5. I welcome any suggestions for fixing the Makefile.PL to work properly.

Thank you,
